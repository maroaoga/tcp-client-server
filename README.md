To build a TCP server that can accept and hold a maximum of N clients, we need to use a combination of socket programming and threading. Here's an outline of how the server can be built
Import the required libraries
Define the IP address and port number for the server
Create a socket and bind it to the host and port:Define a function to handle client connections:
Define a function to accept incoming client connections and assign them ranks:
In the handle_client function, receive commands from the client and distribute them among the other clients:
Start the server by calling the accept_clients function
